      <h2>Introduction to Account-Based Marketing</h2>
      <p>Account-Based Marketing (ABM) has revolutionized how B2B companies approach their most valuable prospects. Unlike traditional marketing that casts a wide net, ABM focuses on specific high-value accounts with personalized campaigns.</p>
      
      <h2>The 3xGrowth ABM Framework</h2>
      <p>Our proven framework consists of three core pillars:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Awareness:</strong> Research-led content that speaks to your ICP's priorities</li>
        <li><strong>Reputation:</strong> Positioning your brand as a trusted authority</li>
        <li><strong>Conversion:</strong> Targeted engagement that results in meetings with decision-makers</li>
      </ul>
      
      <h2>Implementation Strategy</h2>
      <p>Success in ABM requires meticulous planning and execution. Start by identifying your ideal customer profile (ICP) and mapping the decision-making process within target accounts.</p>

    excerpt:
      "Understanding the key differences between lead generation and demand generation can transform your B2B marketing approach.",
    content: `
      <h2>The Fundamental Difference</h2>
      <p>While lead generation focuses on capturing contact information, demand generation builds awareness and interest in your solution before prospects are ready to buy.</p>
      
      <h2>Why Demand Generation Wins</h2>
      <p>In complex B2B sales cycles, decisions aren't made in inboxes—they're made in boardrooms after months of research and reputation checks.</p>
      
      <h2>The 3xGrowth Approach</h2>
      <p>We combine both strategies strategically, using demand generation to build trust and reputation, then leveraging that foundation for highly effective lead generation.</p>
